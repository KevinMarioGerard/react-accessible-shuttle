`Shuttle` is the root component, the main port of entry if you will. The Suttle component is _controlled_ by default,
but this doesn't mean you provide some model and the Shuttle will render on your behalf. With React hooks, Shuttle offers
a robust, yet simple API.

## Usage

```jsx react-live=true
function App() {
    const shuttle = useShuttleState({
        source: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
        target: ['d', 'e', 'f'],
    });

    return (
        <Shuttle {...shuttle}>
            <Shuttle.Container>
                {({ source }, getItemProps) =>
                    source.map((item, index) => (
                        <Shuttle.Item
                            {...getItemProps(index)}
                            key={item}
                            value={item}>
                            {item}
                        </Shuttle.Item>
                    ))
                }
            </Shuttle.Container>
            <Shuttle.Controls />
            <Shuttle.Container>
                {({ target }, getItemProps) =>
                    target.map((item, index) => (
                        <Shuttle.Item
                            {...getItemProps(index)}
                            key={item}
                            value={item}>
                            {item}
                        </Shuttle.Item>
                    ))
                }
            </Shuttle.Container>
        </Shuttle>
    );
}
```

There's a bit going on here, but each part of the shuttle is broken down. See each compound component docs for API details.

### Passing Props
All props are passed to root-level underlying component. If you want to add extra meta-data to `Shuttle.Item`,
for example, you are free to do so. In fact, we use `data-testid` attributes on some components
to perform lookups in our unit tests!

### Rendering Control
Rendering based on a model works in few cases. The majority of the time you want to control _how_ things are renderd
-- it's a small trade-off between verbosity and flexibility.

### Hooks
`useShuttleState` is the real magic the make the Shuttle easy to use. This is one of two public hooks exposed by `react-accessible-shuttle`.
This handles all the complex state logic for you. Internally the hook will setup a series of reducer functions and the most
optimal state storage structure to keep things fast.
