If you're new to React or Reacr Hooks, it's important understand the basic principles before diving in. Knowing at a high level how things
work will enable you to dive in and start using any react component!

## Components

React Components in a component library serve as the highest level API, typically interacted with via JSX.
Take this sample component as an example

```jsx
<Button variant="primary">Hello, World</Button>
```

Components are usually PascalCase (first letter is capitialized) and provide some kind of interface in the form of **props**.
If you're completely new to React, be sure you check out [the react docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html).

## Props

Props serve as our "function" argumnents. They provide us a way to pass additional information to the component.
There are two kinds of props we can pass: **option props** and **HTML props**. Options props are arguments defined by the component.
HTML props are native HTML attributes we can pass to the underlying component.

```jsx
// variant is an option prop
// type is a HTML prop
<Button variant="primary" type="submit">
    Hello, World
</Button>
```

## Render Props

React Accessible Shuttle relies on [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) to provide a flexible API.
This provides us a way to control and customize the internal content of a component.

```jsx
<Shuttle.Container>
    {({ source }, getItemProps) =>
        target.map((item, index) => (
            <Shuttle.Item {...getItemProps(index)} key={item} value={item}>
                {item}
            </Shuttle.Item>
        ))
    }
</Shuttle.Container>
```

## State Hooks

React Accessible Shuttle accepts state props, you can also plug in your own! As a convenience, the shuttle provides a state hook
out of the box.

The options returned from this hook can be passed directly to the Shuttle component,
or used separately to access/extend/modify the state before being passed to the Shuttle component.

```jsx
import { Shuttle, useShuttleState } from 'react-accessible-shuttle';

function App() {
    const state = useShuttleState({
        source: [1, 2, 3],
        target: [4, 5, 6],
    });

    return <Shuttle {...state}>...</Shuttle>;
}
```

## Props Hooks

As the **lowest-level API**, React Accessible Shuttle exposes a few prop hooks. Not surprsingly, these hooks hold most of the
nitty-gritty logic used to modify the Shuttle state.

Currently there is one public hook exposed which enables keyboard navigation.

```jsx
import { Shuttle, useShuttleState, useShuttleKeyboardControls } from 'react-accessible-shuttle';

function App() {
    const state = useShuttleState({
        source: [1, 2, 3],
        target: [4, 5, 6],
    });

+    const controls = useShuttleKeyboardControls(state);

-    return <Shuttle {...state} {...controls}>...</Shuttle>;
+    return <Shuttle {...state} {...controls}>...</Shuttle>;
}
```
