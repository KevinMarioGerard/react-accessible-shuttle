React Accessible Shuttle follows a [compound component](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/compound-components-with-react-hooks) approach.
This basically means we build a component association through static members on a function or class component. For example:

```jsx
function Shuttle() { ... }

Shuttle.Container = () => { ... };
Shuttle.Controls = () => { ... };
```

This allow the `Shuttle` to pass internal information between components without sacrificing your ability to control the rendering process.
Becuase of things like `Context` and hooks, the Shuttle can handle complex internal logic silently, yet providing you with a simple API.
