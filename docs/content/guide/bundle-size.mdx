## Package Structure
React Accessible Shuttle is bundled several different ways:

1. `dist-browser` used by legacy web apps that aren't using webpack or other modern tooling
2. `dist-node` the default main module as CJS
3. `dist-web` the ESM build of the components (works best with Webpack)
4. `dist-src` the transpiled ESM source + tests


## Typings
React Accessible Shuttle exposes typescript typings and flow typings!

1. `dist-flow` contains all the flow types for the project
    * You'll need to manually import these into your `flowconfig` file
2. `dist-types` contains all the typescript typings for the project
    * Pro tip: if you use VSCode you'll get these typings for free ðŸ˜Ž

## CSS
Finally, React Accessible Shuttle contians a tiny (< 1kb) CSS file that contains only the absolute
necessary styles for layout and shuttle item styling.

1. `css` contains the CSS file ([see styling](/guide/styling))
